[Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals) is a new Python library that acts as a unified API layer for different DataFrame backends like pandas, polars, and Modin. It lets you write one codebase that works seamlessly across these backends, which can be really handy, where datasets are often large and workflows need to be scalable.
